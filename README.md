# Tomorrow-Starts-Today
'Tomorrow Starts Today' (Previously Today Starts Tomorrow) allows you to keep track of how many days straight you've achieved something. Whether it'd be for addiction recovery, or a personal improvement like tracking the days without drinking soda, or the days you've worked out consistently, 'Today Starts Tomorrow' allows the flexibility to keep track of anything you like.

# How It Works
Keep track of how many consecutive times you achieved something simply with a click of a button: "Day Advance." 
If you experience a goal setback, they can click “setback,” and their streak will reset, and the highest score counter will update. 
Users also have the flexibility to reset or set their streak amount manually.
