# Tomorrow-Starts-Today
'Tomorrow Starts Today' (Previously Today Starts Tomorrow) allows you to keep track of how many days straight you've achieved something. Whether it'd be for addiction recovery, or a personal improvement like tracking the days without drinking soda, or the days you've worked out consistently, 'Today Starts Tomorrow' allows the flexibility to keep track of anything you like.
